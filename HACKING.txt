Jabber Channel
==============
At the moment, communication about this project occurs on the jabber channel
lib2geom@conference.gristle.org

Help Wanted
===========
We greatly appreciate contributions.  You don't need to be a math-whiz or
über-hacker (though these are definitely appreciated :) ) to help.  The tasks of
code cleanup, consistancy, testing, documentation, and toys mostly just require
perserverance, and benefit the project greatly.

As far as very specialized skill, we are always in need of mathy people, even if
it is just for their insight on problems and techniques (as opposed to coding).

Coding Style
============
Please refer to the Coding Style Guidelines
(http://www.inkscape.org/doc/coding_style.php) if you have specific questions
on the style to use for code.  If reading style guidelines doesn't interest
you, just follow the general style of the surrounding code, so that it is at
least internally consistent.

Compiling
=========
For windows instructions, see README.win32

For Debian-like platforms, the following packages are required:
 cairo v1.1.7 or later (Debian package libcairo2-dev)
 cmake
 make
 libboost-dev
 libgsl0-dev (though eventually it will only be required in tests)
 refblas3* on dapper

To compile, type ‘cmake .’ and then ‘make’.

If you have problems, just ask in the channel.
