/**
 * @class BezierCurve
 * @brief Two-dimensional Bezier curve of arbitrary order.
 *
 * Bezier curves are an expansion of the concept of linear interpolation to n points, and adhere
 * to the definition of curves in the Curve class. Linear segments in 2Geom are in fact Bezier
 * curves of order 1.
 *
 * Let \f$\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1\ldots\mathbf{p}_n}\f$ denote a Bezier curve
 * of order \f$n\f$ defined by the points \f$\mathbf{p}_0, \mathbf{p}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{p}_n\f$.
 * Bezier curve of order 1 is a linear interpolation curve between two points, defined as
 * \f[ \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1}(t) = (1-t)\mathbf{p}_0 + t\mathbf{p}_1 \f]
 * If we now substitute points \f$\mathbf{p_0}\f$ and \f$\mathbf{p_1}\f$ in this definition
 * by linear interpolations, we get the definition of a Bezier curve of order 2, also called
 * a quadratic Bezier curve.
 * \f{align*}{ \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2}(t)
       &= (1-t) \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1}(t) + t \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2}(t) \\
     \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2}(t)
       &= (1-t)^2\mathbf{p}_0 + 2(1-t)t\mathbf{p}_1 + t^2\mathbf{p}_2 \f}
 * By substituting points for quadratic Bezier curves in the original definition,
 * we get a Bezier curve of order 3, called a cubic Bezier curve.
 * \f{align*}{ \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2\mathbf{p}_3}(t)
       &= (1-t) \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2}(t)
       + t \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2\mathbf{p}_3}(t) \\
     \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2\mathbf{p}_3}(t)
       &= (1-t)^3\mathbf{p}_0+3(1-t)^2t\mathbf{p}_1+3(1-t)t^2\mathbf{p}_2+t^3\mathbf{p}_3 \f}
 * In general, a Bezier curve or order \f$n\f$ can be recursively defined as
 * \f[ \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1\ldots\mathbf{p}_n}(t)
     = (1-t) \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_0\mathbf{p}_1\ldots\mathbf{p}_{n-1}}(t)
     + t \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{p}_1\mathbf{p}_2\ldots\mathbf{p}_n}(t) \f]
 *
 * This substitution can be repeated an arbitrary number of times. To picture this, imagine
 * the evaluation of a point on the curve as follows: first, all control points are joined with
 * straight lines, and a point corresponding to the sselected time value is marked on them.
 * Then, the marked points are joined with straight lines and the point corresponding to
 * the time value is marked. This is repeated until only one marked point remains, which is the
 * point at the selected time value.
 *

 *
 * An important property of the Bezier curves is that their parameters (control points)
 * have an intutive geometric interpretation. Because of this, they are frequently used
 * in vector graphics editors.
 *
 * Bezier curves of order 1, 2 and 3 are common enough to have their own more specific subclasses.
 * Note that if you create a generic BezierCurve, you cannot use a dynamic cast to those more
 * specific types, and you might face a slight preformance penalty relative to the more specific
 * classes. To obtain an instance of the correct optimized type, use the optimize()
 * or duplicate() methods. The difference is that optimize() will not create a new object
 * if it can't be optimized or is already an instance of one of the specific types, while
 * duplicate() will always create a new object.

/** @brief Create an optimized instance of the curve.
     * If the curve was created as a generic Bezier curve but has an order between 1 and 3,
     * this method will create a newly allocated curve that is a LineSegment, a QuadraticBezier,
     * or a CubicBezier. For other cases it returns the pointer to the current curve, to avoid
     * allocating extra memory. Be careful when you use this method, because whether you have
     * to delete the returned object or not depends on its return value! If easier deletion
     * semantics are required, you can use the duplicate() method instead, which returns
     * optimized objects by default.
     * @return Pointer to a curve that is an instance of LineSegment, QuadraticBezier
     *         or CubicBezier based on the order. If the object is already an instance
     *         of te more specific types or the order is above 3, a pointer to the original
     *         object is returned instead, and no memory is allocated. */
