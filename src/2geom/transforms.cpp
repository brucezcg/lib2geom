/**
 * @defgroup Transforms Transformation classes
 *
 * Each transformation class represent a set of affine transforms that is closed
 * under multiplication. Those are translation, scaling, rotation, horizontal shearing
 * and vertical shearing. Any affine transform can be obtained by composing those
 * basic operations.
 *
 * Each of the transforms can be applied to points and matrices (using multiplication).
 * Each can also be converted into a matrix (which can represent any composition
 * of transforms generically). All (except translation) use the origin (0,0) as the invariant
 * point (e.g. one that stays in the same place after applying the transform to the plane).
 * To obtain transforms with different invariant points, combine them with translation to
 * and back from the origin. For example, to get a 60 degree rotation around the point @a p:
 * @code Matrix rot_around_p = Translate(-p) * Rotate::from_degrees(60) * Translate(p); @endcode
 *
 * Multiplication of transforms is associative: the result of an expression involving
 * points and matrices is the same regardless of the order of evaluating multiplications.
 * If you need to transform a complicated object
 * by A, then B, and then C, you should first compute the total transform and apply it to the
 * object in one go. This way instead of performing 3 expensive operations, you will only do
 * two very fast matrix multiplications and one complex transformation. Here is an example:
 * @code
   transformed_path = long_path * A * B * C; // wrong! long_path will be transformed 3 times.
   transformed_path = long_path * (A * B * C); // good! long_path will be transformed only once.
   Matrix total = A * B * C; // you can store the transform to apply it to several objects.
   transformed_path = long_path * total; // good!
   @endcode
 * Ordering note: if you compose transformations via multiplication, they are applied
 * from left to right. If you write <code> ptrans = p * A * B * C * D;</code>, then it means
 * that @a ptrans is obtained from @a p by first transforming it by A, then by B, then by C,
 * and finally by D. This is a consequence of interpreting points as row vectors, instead
 * of the more common column vector interpretation; 2Geom's choice leads to more intuitive
 * notation.
