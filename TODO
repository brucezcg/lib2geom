Code Health:
  - remove tests from main code
  - remove macros.cpp
  - standardize naming
  - timing tests
  - reinstate valuable unit tests (focus on corner testing)
  - resolve standards for operator/cast overloads
  - make singlular constructors explicit

Path:
  - inkscape conversions
  - booleans (union, difference, intersection, exclusion, etc)
  - cut
  - dilation/contraction
  - skeletal strokes
  - port existing inkscape path/bezier algorithms
  - implement pw concept

Bezier:
  - implement functions inkscape uses/port existing algorithms
  - move bezier specific code into bezier.h/bezier.cpp
  - eliminate multiple representations (vector<point>, point*, double*, other bezier classes)

D2:
  - add additional useful functions

Pw:
  - add additional useful functions

Point:
  - Test the waters in regards to D2<double>

Toys:
  - generalize to path2
  - improve path-cairo
  - improve toy framework (multiple handle lists, less hardcode)

* generate postscript stroke geometries

* attempt to write nodepath editing stuff in a more generic way

* rewrite convex hull

* replace/improve quadtree with a better spatial index
