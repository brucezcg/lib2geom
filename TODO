Salient tasks:
* Generalize toys (eg, path2 rather than a single bezier)
* Implement inkscape conversion functions
* Cleanup the tests (add cubic_bez_util.cpp)
* Standardize naming

Remove macros.cpp

for Inkscape:
  - "set" operations:
  - union
  - difference
  - intersection
  - mutual exclusion
  - cut
- dilating/contracting shapes
- generate postscript stroke geometries
- rewrite bezier-utils to use paths

* convert toy-cairo to gtkmm
* skeletal strokes in the long run to
* make a list of all bezier ops used in inkscape, implement list
* porting existing algorithms from inkscape to the new path datastructure is probably the most valuable
* improving the cairo backend
* we also need to make better unit tests, and devise timing tests
* checking the svg-d parser
* attempting to write nodepath editing stuff in a more generic way
* split? (given a list of locations, insert a node at each of those points, or convert each to a separate subpath)
* convert a set of subpaths to a set of singleton paths
* convert a set of paths to a single path
* convex hull
* possible abstract transformation class
* add toMatrix methods to non-matrix transformations
